### Calculating acoustic Indices 

#### What are acoustic indcies?

Acoustic indcies are mathametical functions that consider spectral and temporal information obtained from audio recordings. They can be used to  analyse large audio datasets and monitor biodiversity without the need to determine species identity. 

Many different types of acoustic indcies exist, however, here is a list of the most commonly used indices. 

| Acoustic index                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Developed for                                                                                      | Reference                                                 |

#### Calculating acoustic indices in R Studio                                              

Multiple acoustic indices can be calculated in bulk using the'soundecology' package in R Studio (Villanueva-Rivera & Pijanowski, 2018)

```
install.packages("soundecology")
library(soundecology)

multiple_sounds("name_of_your_respository", resultfile = "name_of_your_output.csv",
                soundindex = "acoustic_complexity")

multiple_sounds("name_of_your_respository", resultfile = "name_of_your_output.csv",
                soundindex = "acoustic_diversity")

multiple_sounds("name_of_your_respository", resultfile = "name_of_your_output.csv",
                soundindex = "acoustic_evenness")

multiple_sounds("name_of_your_respository", resultfile = "name_of_your_output.csv",
                soundindex = "bioacoustic_index")

multiple_sounds("name_of_your_respository", resultfile = "name_of_your_output.csv",
                soundindex = "H")

multiple_sounds("name_of_your_respository", resultfile = "name_of_your_output.csv",
                soundindex = "ndsi")
```
It is also possible to specify the min and max frequency, cluster size, and FFT window size. 

For example:
```
	acoustic_complexity(soundfile, min_freq = 2, max_freq = 10, j = 5, fft_w = 512)
```

| Argument  | Description                                                                                             |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| soundfile | an object of class Wave loaded with the function readWave of the tuneR package.                         |
| min_freq  | miminum frequency to use when calculating the value, in Hertz. The default is NA.                       |
| max_freq  | maximum frequency to use when calculating the value, in Hertz. The default is the maximum for the file. |
| j         | the cluster size, in seconds.                                                                           |
| fft_w     | FFT window to use.                                                                                      |

### Data handling and manipulation

#### Add a column for a catagorical variable to large datasets using dplyr

In this case, we are going to add a new column to our dataset called 'Season'. Adding this variable to a dataset with >500,000 rows using Excel is challenging, but it's simple in R Studio. 

```
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("cluster")
library(dplyr)
library(cluster)

# Load data 
Data <- read.table("your_dataframe.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

# Define your groups and row numbers
group_info <- data.frame(Group = c("Spring", "Summer", "Autumn", "Winter"),
                         StartRow = c(1, 121819, 230832, 372640),
                         EndRow = c(121818, 230831, 372639, 465395))

# Ensure that group_info is sorted by StartRow
group_info <- group_info[order(group_info$StartRow), ]

# Use mutate to add the new column to the dataframe 
Data <- Data %>%
  mutate(Group = factor(findInterval(rownames(Data), group_info$StartRow), 
                        labels = group_info$Group))
```		


### Data visulisation 

#### Rose plots to visualise daily and seasonal variation 

```
jpeg("Rose Plot.jpeg", width = 7, height = 7, units = 'in', res = 300)
ggplot(data=Data,aes(x=Month,y=Season,fill=Value))+ 
  geom_tile(colour="black",size=0.1)+ 
  scale_fill_gradientn(name="Bioacoustic index", colours=c("lightgreen","darkgreen"))+
  coord_polar()+xlab("")+ylab("") + theme_minimal() 
dev.off()
```
