### Part 2: Calculating Acoustic Indices 

Acoustic indcies are mathametical functions that consider spectral and temporal information obtained from audio recordings. They can be used to  analyse large audio datasets and monitor biodiversity without the need to determine species identity. 

Many different types of acoustic indcies exist, however, here is a list of the most commonly used indices. 

| Acoustic index                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Developed for                                                                                      | Reference                                                 |

| Acoustic evenness index (AEI)                 | “Calculated by dividing the spectrogram into bins (default 10) and taking the proportion of the signals in each bin above a threshold (default −50 dBFS). The AEI is the result of the Gini index applied to these bins” (Villanueva-Rivera, Pijanowski & Villanueva-Rivera, 2018)                                        | Birds and terrestrial biota (in forest, agricultural land and urban areas, Indiana, United States) | Villanueva-Rivera et al.

| Acoustic complexity index (ACI)               | “Calculated on the basis of a matrix of the intensities extrapolated from the spectrogram (divided into temporal steps and frequency bins), the ACI calculates the absolute difference between two adjacent values of intensity in a single frequency bin” (Pieretti et al., 2011)                                        | Birds (in temperate woodland, Italy)                                                               | Pieretti et al.

The area values are thus a function of both the sound level and the number of frequency bands used by the avifauna” (Boelman, Asner, Hart, & Martin, 2007)  | Birds and terrestrial biota (in forest, savanna, woodland and shrubland, Hawaii, United States)    | Boelman et al.

| Normalized difference soundscape index (NDSI) | Seeks to “estimate the level of anthropogenic disturbance on the soundscape by computing the ratio of human-generated (anthrophony) to biological (biophony) acoustic components found in field collected sound samples” (Kasten, Gage, Fox, & Joo, 2012)                                                                 | Birds and terrestrial biota (on an island in Twin Lakes, MI, United States)                        | Kasten et al.

Multiple acoustic indices can be calculated in bulk using the'soundecology' package in R Studio (Villanueva-Rivera & Pijanowski, 2018)

```
install.packages("soundecology")
library(soundecology)

multiple_sounds("name_of_your_respository", resultfile = "name_of_your_output.csv",
                soundindex = "acoustic_complexity")

multiple_sounds("name_of_your_respository", resultfile = "name_of_your_output.csv",
                soundindex = "acoustic_diversity")

multiple_sounds("name_of_your_respository", resultfile = "name_of_your_output.csv",
                soundindex = "acoustic_evenness")

multiple_sounds("name_of_your_respository", resultfile = "name_of_your_output.csv",
                soundindex = "bioacoustic_index")

multiple_sounds("name_of_your_respository", resultfile = "name_of_your_output.csv",
                soundindex = "H")

multiple_sounds("name_of_your_respository", resultfile = "name_of_your_output.csv",
                soundindex = "ndsi")
```
It is also possible to specify the min and max frequency, cluster size, and FFT window size. 

For example:
```
	acoustic_complexity(soundfile, min_freq = 2, max_freq = 10, j = 5, fft_w = 512)
```

| Argument  | Description                                                                                             |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| soundfile | an object of class Wave loaded with the function readWave of the tuneR package.                         |
| min_freq  | miminum frequency to use when calculating the value, in Hertz. The default is NA.                       |
| max_freq  | maximum frequency to use when calculating the value, in Hertz. The default is the maximum for the file. |
| j         | the cluster size, in seconds.                                                                           |
| fft_w     | FFT window to use.                                                                                      |
